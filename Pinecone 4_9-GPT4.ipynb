of microbial organisms inhabiting marine environments, cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the most abundant photosynthetic cells. prochlorococcus and synechococcus, the two most common cyanobacteria, account for 30% of global carbon fixation (through the photosynthetic process in which sugars are manufactured from carbon dioxide and water). by drawing on natural resources, these microbes use photosystems (ps) i and ii (the two reaction centers in photosynthesis) to harness energy. \\r\\n\\r\\nintriguingly, some viruses that infect cyanobacteria (called cyanophage), carry genes that encode two psii core reaction-center proteins: psba (the most rapidly turned over core protein in all oxygen-yielding photosynthetic organisms) and psbd (which forms a complex with psba). by expressing their own copies of psba and psbd during infection, these cyanophages have managed to co-opt host genes to suit their own purposes: enhancing photosynthesis. it seems likely that they do this in the interests of their own fitness, since cyanophage production is optimal when photosynthesis is maintained during infection. \\r\\n\\r\\nuntil recently, only a small sample of cyanophages had been examined, leaving open the questions of how widespread psii genes are in these organisms and where the genes came from. to answer these questions, matthew sullivan, debbie lindell, sallie chisholm, and colleagues examined a pool of 33 cyanophage isolates (cultured from samples collected from the sargasso sea and the red sea), along with data already available for nine other cyanophages, for the presence of psba and psbd genes. they found psba was present in 88% and psbd in 50% of the cyanophages studied. by analyzing the sequences of these genes along with those from prochlorococcus and synechococcus host genes, they reconstructed the evolutionary history of how the psii genes entered the phage genomes. \\r\\n\\r\\ncyanophages are divided morphologically into three main families (podoviridae, myoviridae, and siphoviridae). looking at the distributions of the psii genes across the different families, sullivan, lindell, et al. saw that psba was present in all myoviruses and all prochlorococcus podoviruses, but not in prochlorococcus siphoviruses or synechococcus podoviruses. the high levels of sequence conservation between the different cyanophages suggest that this gene is probably functional and that it is likely to increase the reproductive fitness of the phage. the length of the latent period may impact the distribution pattern of psba among these phage groups. however, more information about the physiological characteristics of cyanophages is needed to further investigate these possibilities. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe second gene, psbd, was less prolific but was seen in four of the 20 prochlorococcus myoviruses and 17 of the 20 synechococcus myoviruses examined—all of which also encoded psba. myoviruses are known to infect a wider range of cyanobacteria than the other cyanophage families. indeed, when investigated, the psbd-encoding myoviruses correlated with those known to have a broader host range. perhaps the co-opting of both psii genes ensures a functional psba–psbd protein complex to enhance infection for these cyanophages that are able to infect a wider range of hosts. \\r\\n\\r\\nto determine when the psii genes had been transferred into the phage and from where, sullivan, lindell, et al. investigated the nucleotide sequences of psba and psbd from both prochlorococcus and synechococcus host and cyanophage. using meticulous sequence analyses and standard statistical methods, they generated phylogenetic trees to explain the evolutionary history of these two psii genes. \\r\\n\\r\\nby analyzing the clusters of sequence types within the resulting tree, the authors saw evidence that psba was transferred from the cyanobacteria host genome into the phage genome on four independent occasions and two separate occasions for psbd. exchange events were generally host-range specific, meaning that prochlorococcus genes transferred to prochlorococcus phages, and so on. however, a few intriguing exceptions, where genes did not cluster with their hosts, were observed; these might result from genetic exchange between members of two different phage families (one of broader host range) during co-infection of the same host. \\r\\n\\r\\nsullivan, lindell, et al. were also able to use their dataset to investigate a previous suggestion that alterations in the nucleotide distributions within individual psii genes (creating a kind of patchwork gene) demonstrate that intragenic recombination has taken place. indeed, they confirm that this occurs among synechococcus myoviruses and prochlorococcus podoviruses. in some cases involving synechococcus, intragenic recombination appears to have happened in both host-to-phage and phage-to-host directions for both genes; and, for some prochlorococcus genes, dna from

cyanophage molecular mixing bowl of photosynthesis genes.; Content: among the wealth of microbial organisms inhabiting marine environments, cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the most abundant photosynthetic cells. prochlorococcus and synechococcus, the two most common cyanobacteria, account for 30% of global carbon fixation (through the photosynthetic process in which sugars are manufactured from carbon dioxide and water). by drawing on natural resources, these microbes use photosystems (ps) i and ii (the two reaction centers in photosynthesis) to harness energy. \\r\\n\\r\\nintriguingly, some viruses that infect cyanobacteria (called cyanophage), carry genes that encode two psii core reaction-center proteins: psba (the most rapidly turned over core protein in all oxygen-yielding photosynthetic organisms) and psbd (which forms a complex with psba). by expressing their own copies of psba and psbd during infection, these cyanophages have managed to co-opt host genes to suit their own purposes: enhancing photosynthesis. it seems likely that they do this in the interests of their own fitness, since cyanophage production is optimal when photosynthesis is maintained during infection. \\r\\n\\r\\nuntil recently, only a small sample of cyanophages had been examined, leaving open the questions of how widespread psii genes are in these organisms and where the genes came from. to answer these questions, matthew sullivan, debbie lindell, sallie chisholm, and colleagues examined a pool of 33 cyanophage isolates (cultured from samples collected from the sargasso sea and the red sea), along with data already available for nine other cyanophages, for the presence of psba and psbd genes. they found psba was present in 88% and psbd in 50% of the cyanophages studied. by analyzing the sequences of these genes along with those from prochlorococcus and synechococcus host genes, they reconstructed the evolutionary history of how the psii genes entered the phage genomes. \\r\\n\\r\\ncyanophages are divided morphologically into three main families (podoviridae, myoviridae, and siphoviridae). looking at the distributions of the psii genes across the different families, sullivan, lindell, et al. saw that psba was present in all myoviruses and all prochlorococcus podoviruses, but not in prochlorococcus siphoviruses or synechococcus podoviruses. the high levels of sequence conservation between the different cyanophages suggest that this gene is probably functional and that it is likely to increase the reproductive fitness of the phage. the length of the latent period may impact the distribution pattern of psba among these phage groups. however, more information about the physiological characteristics of cyanophages is needed to further investigate these possibilities. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe second gene, psbd, was less prolific but was seen in four of the 20 prochlorococcus myoviruses and 17 of the 20 synechococcus myoviruses examined—all of which also encoded psba. myoviruses are known to infect a wider range of cyanobacteria than the other cyanophage families. indeed, when investigated, the psbd-encoding myoviruses correlated with those known to have a broader host range. perhaps the co-opting of both psii genes ensures a functional psba–psbd protein complex to enhance infection for these cyanophages that are able to infect a wider range of hosts. \\r\\n\\r\\nto determine when the psii genes had been transferred into the phage and from where, sullivan, lindell, et al. investigated the nucleotide sequences of psba and psbd from both prochlorococcus and synechococcus host and cyanophage. using meticulous sequence analyses and standard statistical methods, they generated phylogenetic trees to explain the evolutionary history of these two psii genes. \\r\\n\\r\\nby analyzing the clusters of sequence types within the resulting tree, the authors saw evidence that psba was transferred from the cyanobacteria host genome into the phage genome on four independent occasions and two separate occasions for psbd. exchange events were generally host-range specific, meaning that prochlorococcus genes transferred to prochlorococcus phages, and so on. however, a few intriguing exceptions, where genes did not cluster with their hosts, were observed; these might result from genetic exchange between members of two different phage families (one of broader host range) during co-infection of the same host. \\r\\n\\r\\nsullivan, lindell, et al. were also able to use their dataset to investigate a previous suggestion that alterations in the nucleotide distributions within individual psii genes (creating a kind of patchwork gene) demonstrate that intragenic recombination has taken place. indeed, they confirm that this occurs among synechococcus myoviruses and prochlorococcus podoviruses. in some cases involving synechococcus, intragenic recombination appears to have happened in both host-to-phage and phage-to-host directions for both genes; and, for some prochlorococcus genes, dna from an unknown source also seems to have been inserted. occasionally, intragenic exchanges are also seen between synechococcus hosts. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe authors compare their cultured results to those from wild phage sequences from the pacific ocean and see that much of the natural diversity is

deficient mice; Content: insulin-like growth factor-i (igf-i) belongs to the family of insulin-related peptides that fulfils a key role during the late development of the nervous system. human igf1 mutations cause profound deafness, poor growth and mental retardation. accordingly, igf1−/− null mice are dwarfs that have low survival rates, cochlear alterations and severe sensorineural deafness. presbycusis (age-related hearing loss) is a common disorder associated with aging that causes social and cognitive problems. aging is also associated with a decrease in circulating igf-i levels and this reduction has been related to cognitive and brain alterations, although there is no information as yet regarding the relationship between presbycusis and igf-i biodisponibility. here we present a longitudinal study of wild type igf1+/+ and null igf1−/− mice from 2 to 12 months of age comparing the temporal progression of several parameters: hearing, brain morphology, cochlear cytoarchitecture, insulin-related factors and igf gene expression and igf-i serum levels. complementary invasive and non-invasive techniques were used, including auditory brainstem-evoked response (abr) recordings and in vivo mri brain imaging. igf1−/− null mice presented profound deafness at all the ages studied, without any obvious worsening of hearing parameters with aging. igf1+/+ wild type mice suffered significant age-related hearing loss, their auditory thresholds and peak i latencies augmenting as they aged, in parallel with a decrease in the circulating levels of igf-i. accordingly, there was an age-related spiral ganglion degeneration in wild type mice that was not evident in the igf1 null mice. however, the igf1−/− null mice in turn developed a prematurely aged stria vascularis reminiscent of the diabetic strial phenotype. our data indicate that igf-i is required for the correct development and maintenance of hearing, supporting the idea that igf-i-based therapies could contribute to prevent or ameliorate age-related hearing loss.'}, {'paper': 'W1986374968', 'title': 'Surface Temperatures of Cacti--Influences of Environmental and Morphological Factors', 'abstract': 'an energy

opiate detection. the response to the opioid receptor agonist morphine and a synthetic opioid peptide was analyzed by absorbance readings in an aggregation assay. it was shown that both agonists caused aggregation of pigment granules in the melanophores, and the cells appeared lighter. the pharmacology of the expressed receptors was very similar to its mammalian counterpart, as evidenced by competitive inhibition by increasing concentrations of the opioid receptor inhibitor naloxone. transfection of melanophores with selected receptors enables the creation of numerous melanophore biosensors, which respond selectively to certain substances. the melanophore biosensor has potential use for measurement of substances in body fluids such as saliva, blood plasma and urine.'},

mass during independent existence. hatchlings are limited to\\nthe tropics and near-surface water. adults, obligate predators on gelatinous\\nplankton, encounter cold water at depth (<1280 m) or high

the extensibility or ductility of the interfaces may be more important than their strength and toughness to produce toughness at the macroscale.'}, {'paper': 'W1691917253', 'title': 'Keeping cool: Enhanced optical reflection and radiative heat dissipation in Saharan silver ants', 'abstract': 'saharan silver ants, cataglyphis bombycina, forage under extreme temperature conditions in the african desert. we show that the ants’ conspicuous silvery appearance is created by a dense array of triangular hairs with two thermoregulatory effects. they enhance not only the reflectivity of the ant’s body surface in the visible and near-infrared range of the spectrum, where solar radiation culminates, but also the emissivity of the ant in the mid-infrared. the latter effect enables the animals to efficiently dissipate heat back to the surroundings via blackbody radiation under full daylight conditions. this biological solution for a thermoregulatory problem may lead to the development of biomimetic coatings for passive radiative cooling of objects.', 'level1': 'chemically_assemble/break_down', 'level2': 'chemically_break_down', 'level3': 'chemically_break_down_organic_compounds', 'mag_terms': 'biosensor', 'combined': 'Title: Keeping cool: Enhanced optical reflection and radiative heat dissipation in Saharan silver ants;

used high angles of attack (44.15±3.12°), far higher than\\nthe angles at which airplane wings would stall, yet generated higher lift\\ncoefficients (1.48±0.18) than would be expected for a stalled wing.\\nmovements of the limbs were strongly correlated with body rotations,\\nsuggesting that sugar gliders make extensive use of limb movements to control\\ntheir orientation during gliding flight. in addition, among individuals,\\ndifferent limb movements were associated with a given body rotation,\\nsuggesting that individual variation exists in the control of body rotations.\\nunder similar
